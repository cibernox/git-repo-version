# git-repo-version

Generates a version string based on the version specified in your `package.json` and the sha revision of
the current commit/branch.

## Install

Typically you will only need to install this as a devDependency as follows

`npm install --save-dev git-repo-version`

## Usage

This plugin automatically exports a function that when called calculates return the version string with a sha of the given length (defaults to 8). You can also specify second parameter to include commit date in the output `{ includeDate: true }`.

```js
var getVersion = require('git-repo-version');
getVersion(); // "1.5.0-beta.1+pre.a1b2c3d4"
getVersion({ shaLength: 10 }); // "1.5.0-beta.1+pre.a1b2c3d4e5"
getVersion({ shaLength: 10, includeDate: true }); // "1.5.0-beta.1+pre.a1b2c3d4e5 2016-10-24T18:26:53.000Z"
```

The way this function works is:

* If your app has a version number in its `package.json`, it will use that version number and append
the SHA of the current commit at the end (p.e. `1.5.0-beta.1+pre.a1b2c3d4`)
* If your app doesn't has a version number in the `package.json`, it will use the name of the current
branch and append the SHA (p.e. `develp.a1b2c3d4`)
* In the previous case, if your current HEAD is not a branch, it will use the string `DETACHED_HEAD`
instead (p.e `DETACHED_HEAD.1a2b3c4d`)

## Running tests
